# Overview

Welcome to my first GIS project. I am looking for a new apartment and figured this would be a perfect time to learn how to use the ArcGIS library. 

I used VSCode as a coding environment and ArcGIS to create the API with all of the geographical data. 

In Rexburg, there are a lot of apartments listed on Facebook Marketplace. I often see apartments and think that I should look into it and then immediately forget to do anything about it. So an app where I can see all of the apartments I liked would be helpful to me personally. So I created a simple app that displays all 30 of the apartments I've looked into. 

This is a demonstration of my first version of my GIS app:

# Development Environment

ArcGIS is a really amazing library for beginners because everything is so well documented. Getting the API data to display was a bit tricky for my first time, but there are so many amazing tutorials and sample code that it only took me a few days to get something pretty functional. 

# Useful Websites

ArcGIS Tutorials I Used:
* [Create Feature Layer](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/data-hosting/tutorials/tools/create-a-new-feature-layer/)
* [Query a feature layer (SQL)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/query-a-feature-layer-sql/)

# Future Work

Things I could add to this app
* Save Apartments in a "To Contact" list
* Add a contact, message, or email option
* Add images of the apartments that can display and scroll through
